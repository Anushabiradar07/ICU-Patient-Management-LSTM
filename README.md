# ICU Patient Management and Resource Allocation using LSTM-RNN  

## Project Description  
Efficient management of ICU patients and critical care resources is essential in healthcare.  
This project builds a **predictive model** that analyzes patient data and forecasts ICU requirements, helping optimize **bed allocation, staff management, and timely intervention**.  

- **Problem:** ICU resources are limited, and sudden patient influx can cause shortages.  
- **Solution:** A predictive system using **LSTM-RNN** to analyze patient records and predict outcomes, improving ICU management and reducing resource strain.

## Model  
- **Architecture:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Training:** Time-series based patient monitoring data  
- **Output:** Predicted patient severity and ICU resource requirement
